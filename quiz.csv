Contacting medical control is not a bad idea, and telling the family that they have no rights is insensitive, so it will be your job to calmly and as empathetically as possible explain that you are bound by the rules of the state to honor the patient’s wishes to “Do Not Resuscitate”.  The purpose of a DNR is for when the patient is unconscious or unable to express their wishes, those wishes can still be followed.

If he wears the O2 mask his lungs will be filled with 100% oxygen soon, and he will be able to maintain adequate oxygen levels in his blood longer after he loses consciousness. Therefore, placing this patient on a non-rebreather mask might buy him a lot of time.",,,,,

Finding any arterial bleeding quickly is important for this patient because: ,22,It is often heavy and difficult to control,Clots will form quickly,It will cause blood pressure to rise,It is the least difficult to control,,"Arterial bleeding is under high pressure, it is therefore typically heavy and difficult to control since it is also more difficult to clot off. ",,,,,
932,Your patient just lost control of his motorcycle and laid it down on the road way. He is complaining of a huge rash like injury that is slowly oozing out blood. The primary concern for this bleeding is:,22,Infection since the bleeding is capillary in nature,The patient bleeding out since the injury is arterial in nature,The patient losing a significant amount of blood because the injury is venous in nature,The organs near the injury losing valuable oxygenated blood ,,"The injury described is capillary in nature and, in most cases, (like anti-clot or blood thinning drugs) the patient will not lose a significant amount of blood and will self clot.

This increases oxygenation of the tissues. ",,,,,
935,If a patient bleeds through your initial attempt to control bleeding it is important to not take off the initial bandage because: ,22,It is an important part in clot formation,It takes too long to remove and start over,It is biohazardous,It increases the chances for infection,,Ensure that the first bandage you put on is done correctly because it will become an essential part of the clot formation. Taking off the initial bandage could cause the clot to dislodge and increase the bleeding. ,,,,,

944,Your patient is suffering from a severe laceration that is spurting out bright red blood. You've attempted to control the bleeding with direct pressure to no avail. Without a tourniquet present how else could you stop the bleeding? ,22,Inflate a blood pressure cuff to 150 mmHg (or above) distal to the injury,Wrap your hands around the limb and squeeze until the bleeding stops,"Attempt to hold the limb above the heart, hold direct pressure, then find a pressure point to limit blood flowing into that extremity","Do not worry about it, do the best to hold pressure on the wound and drive emergent",,Inflating a blood pressure cuff above 150 mmHg should be more than enough to function as a tourniquet until a proper one can be found.
